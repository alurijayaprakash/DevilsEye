### Project Description :
Before students used to attend classes physically and lecturers used to manually teach them while keeping an eye on them. But, due to the era of new normal we are here using the advantage of the internet and attending classes through Zoom video conferencing. Where a student needs to join the class through a Zoom link and have to keep their Camera and microphone ON during the class.

But students will be students whatever the era it might be. Therefore, during the zoom sessions the student will switch OFF their camera and microphone and that is the new normal type of bunking the classes. Having said that, the mentor will be unaware of the status of the student. Finding if the student is attending the class or not is a tough task to do. Therefore, to overcome this problem we are developing an application called “DEVIL’S EYE”, which keeps popping certain questions in periodical timings so as to make sure if the student is attentive during the class or not. If they are attentive then they will answer the right questions and get the attendance of that session. If not, they will miss their attendance.
